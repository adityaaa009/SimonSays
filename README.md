# SimonSays Game
- The game starts when the user presses any key.
- Each level, a new random color is added to the sequence (gameSeq), and the user must repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.
- Each user click is checked against the game sequence. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends and resets.
- If the user completes the sequence correctly, the game advances to the next level with a longer sequence.
- Visual feedback is given by flashing buttons for both the game and user actions.
